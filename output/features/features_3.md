- **Feature: Multi-Skill Search Interface**
  - Description: Develop a user-friendly interface within the existing frontend system that allows recruiters to input multiple skills for candidate search, utilizing React components for skill selection.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - The interface must allow multi-select functionality for skills using dropdowns or checkboxes.
    - Recruiters should be able to view all selected skills before triggering the search.
    - The interface must be responsive and user-friendly, providing real-time validation of input selections.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Display error messages for invalid selections (e.g., selecting an empty skill list) during the search execution.
    - Log user interaction errors to improve interface robustness in future updates.

- **Feature: Candidate Search API Endpoint**
  - Description: Implement a new endpoint in the Node.js/Express API that enables recruiters to perform searches based on specified skills and additional filters.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - The API should support query parameters for multiple skills, experience level, location, and availability.
    - It must return a JSON response containing candidate details (name, contact info, skills summary) in under 2 seconds for a maximum of 1,000 candidates.
    - The API response should include pagination to handle larger result sets efficiently.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Validate query parameters and return a user-friendly error message for any improperly formatted requests.
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API and log attempts for security auditing.

- **Feature: Candidate Search Result Display**
  - Description: Create a component that displays the search results for candidates in a clear, organized format on the recruiter interface.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - The results should present candidate names, contact information, and a summary of their skills in a list format.
    - Each candidate's detail view should be clickable to provide further information in a modal or dedicated page.
    - Ensure that the display is paginated for large result sets, with navigation controls included.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Provide appropriate messages if no candidates are found for the search criteria.
    - Log instances of rendering issues for review and troubleshooting.

- **Feature: Save and Notify for Saved Searches**
  - Description: Build functionality allowing recruiters to save their search queries and receive notifications for new candidates that match these queries.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Recruiters should be able to save searches with a name and description, which can be accessed later from their dashboard.
    - Implement a notification system to alert recruiters via email or in-app notifications when new candidates match their saved searches.
    - Notifications must be customizable with options to enable or disable alerts for individual saved searches.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Ensure notifications are only sent when new matches occur; establish a logging mechanism for notification failures.
    - Validate that saved searches are linked to the correct recruiter profile in the system to prevent data leakage.

- **Feature: Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations**
  - Description: Ensure that all aspects of the candidate search feature are compliant with GDPR and CCPA data privacy regulations regarding candidate information.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Implement encryption for candidate data, especially skill information, during transmission and at rest.
    - Integrate a consent mechanism that captures agreements to data processing before candidate data is displayed in search results.
    - Conduct regular compliance audits to verify that systems and processes align with current regulations.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Log and report any compliance violations to the development team for immediate remediation.
    - Generate alerts for recruiters if data handling practices fall out of compliance, with clear guidance on corrective actions.
