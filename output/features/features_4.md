- **Feature: Candidate Summary Generation API Endpoint**
  - Description: Enhance the existing Node.js/Express backend by implementing a new API endpoint that automatically generates candidate summaries. This endpoint will pull relevant data from the PostgreSQL database upon candidate creation or update.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - The endpoint must return a summary in JSON format containing candidate name, contact information, skills, and relevant experience.
    - The summary generation should trigger automatically with a POST request upon candidate data creation or an UPDATE request on existing profiles.
    - API response times must be under 500ms for efficiency.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Return error messages for invalid or missing candidate information during API calls.
    - Implement middleware to log errors and monitor request performances for troubleshooting.

- **Feature: Summary Customization Interface for Recruiters**
  - Description: Develop a user-friendly interface within the recruiter dashboard, allowing recruiters to customize and edit automatically generated candidate summaries before presenting them to managers.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - The interface must allow editing of each section of the summary, including skills and experience.
    - Changes made to the summary should be stored in the database for future retrieval and must not overwrite automatically generated data unless explicitly saved.
    - The edit interface must maintain visual consistency with the overall platform design.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Provide visual feedback for unsaved changes and notify recruiters of required fields that must be filled before saving.
    - Log instances of editing errors for development review and future resolutions.

- **Feature: Summary Display Integration in Recruiter Dashboard**
  - Description: Integrate a component displaying candidate summaries in the existing recruiter dashboard using React, ensuring responsiveness and user-friendly navigation.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - The component must present summaries clearly, with properly formatted sections for each candidate's information.
    - Implement pagination for displaying summaries when the number of candidates exceeds a specified limit.
    - The display must be compatible with different screen sizes and devices for usability.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Handle scenarios where no candidate summaries are available by displaying a user-friendly message.
    - Keep an error log for any issues encountered in retrieving or displaying candidate summary data.

- **Feature: Compliance and Data Privacy Assurance**
  - Description: Ensure that candidate summaries generated and displayed adhere to GDPR and CCPA standards, particularly concerning sensitive information exposure.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Data handling compliance must be validated, ensuring only necessary information is displayed in the summaries.
    - Implement consent management for candidate data usage and summary creation, ensuring user agreements are documented.
    - Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance mechanisms are effective and up-to-date.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Notify developers of any compliance failures or inconsistencies in data protection practices.
    - Maintain logs of compliance checks and any data privacy issues encountered during summary generation or display.

- **Feature: Comprehensive Summary Generation Testing**
  - Description: Establish a testing framework using Jest and Supertest to thoroughly validate the summary generation and associated functionalities, ensuring robustness and reliability.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Unit tests must cover all functionalities, including API responses, summary generation logic, and error handling scenarios.
    - Integration tests should validate end-to-end processes from candidate data input to summary display in the dashboard.
    - Achieve a minimum of 90% code coverage for critical components related to candidate summary generation.
  - Validation/Error Handling:
    - Implement logging for test failures, providing details for easy debugging.
    - Set up a process for continuously running tests in CI/CD to catch and address issues early in the development cycle.
