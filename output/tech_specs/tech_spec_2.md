# Resume Skill Extraction Feature Technical Specification

## **Description**
The Resume Skill Extraction feature allows recruiters to automatically extract key skills and relevant information from candidate resumes to streamline the screening process. This feature will enhance the recruitment system functionality by utilizing advanced parsing techniques to identify and categorize skills from uploaded resumes.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
1. The system should successfully extract predefined skill sets (e.g., programming languages, software tools, certifications) from resumes.
2. Extracted skills must be stored in a structured format within the database, linked to the respective candidate profile.
3. Recruiters should receive a notification that lists the extracted skills upon successful parsing of a resume.
4. If the parsing fails, the system should provide a clear error message indicating the failure reason.
5. The resume skill extraction process must be compliant with data privacy regulations.

## **Implementation Notes**
- **Parsing Library**: Utilize a robust resume parsing library with NLP capabilities, such as `resumepdf-parser` or similar, to enhance accuracy and handle various resume formats.
- **Skill Standardization**: Develop a standardized list of skills to be parsed, using industry standards as reference points (e.g., CSRankings or the O*NET database).
- **Database**: Use PostgreSQL to store extracted skills, ensuring that each skill entry can reference the candidate profile it belongs to while maintaining normalized database design.
- **API Development**: Extend the existing Node.js/Express API, incorporating a new endpoint dedicated to handling the skill extraction process from parsed resumes.
- **Data Validation**: Implement validation checks on the extracted skills to ensure they align with the standardized list before being saved to the database.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporate logging and detailed error messages using a middleware approach to manage potential issues with parsing and data extraction.
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure that the entire process of skill extraction adheres to GDPR or relevant data protection laws, implementing necessary data encryption and user consent mechanisms.
- **Testing**: Carry out comprehensive unit and integration tests to validate parsing accuracy and system performance, leveraging frameworks like Jest and Supertest for testing API endpoints.
