# Candidate Profile Summary Feature Technical Specification

## **Description**
The Candidate Profile Summary feature allows recruiters to view concise summaries of candidate profiles, facilitating efficient assessment and presentation to hiring managers. This feature enhances the existing recruitment system by automating the transformation of detailed candidate data into user-friendly summaries.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
1. The system must generate a summary that includes key candidate details such as name, contact information, and a concise overview of skills and relevant experience.
2. Summaries should be automatically generated upon candidate profile creation or update, ensuring they are always current.
3. Recruiters must have the option to customize or edit the summary before presenting it to managers.
4. The summary display should be formatted for clear visibility and be consistent with the overall user interface design.
5. All generated summaries must adhere to data privacy regulations, ensuring that only the necessary data is displayed without sensitive information.

## **Implementation Notes**
- **Backend Development**: Enhance the existing Node.js/Express API to include a new endpoint for generating candidate summaries. This endpoint should pull relevant data from the existing candidate database.
- **Summary Generation Logic**: Develop a service that compiles and formats candidate data into a readable summary, potentially utilizing templating frameworks or libraries (e.g., Handlebars or EJS).
- **Database Integration**: Ensure that the system leverages the existing PostgreSQL database where candidate information is stored, querying it efficiently while considering performance implications.
- **Cache Management**: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to store summary results for frequently accessed candidates to minimize database load and improve response times.
- **User Interface**: Utilize React to integrate the summary display within the recruiter dashboard, ensuring a seamless user experience. Apply responsive design principles to maintain usability across devices.
- **Customizability**: Provide an interface for recruiters to edit the generated summary, storing these changes in the database to allow for tailored presentations to different managers.
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure that summary generation complies with GDPR and CCPA, incorporating mechanisms like data encryption and user consent where required.
- **Testing Strategy**: Establish a robust testing plan using Jest and Supertest to validate both unit and integration tests for the summary generation logic and the API endpoint.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation detailing the summary generation process, including any user customizations available and examples of usage scenarios.
