# Candidate Skill Search Feature Technical Specification

## **Description**
The Candidate Skill Search feature allows recruiters to search and filter candidates based on specific skills, improving the efficiency of candidate selection. This feature builds on existing functionalities by adding a robust search mechanism that utilizes advanced querying techniques and potentially leverages machine learning for semantic understanding of skills.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
1. The system must allow recruiters to search by multiple skills using an intuitive search interface.
2. The search should return candidates that match any of the specified skills (inclusive search).
3. The search results must display relevant details about each candidate, including their name, contact information, and a summary of their skills.
4. The feature should support advanced filters such as experience level, location, and availability.
5. Performance of the search functionality should remain swift, returning results within 2 seconds for searches involving up to 1,000 candidates.
6. Recruiters should be able to save search queries for future use and receive notifications for new candidates that match these saved searches.
7. All candidate data retrieval should comply with data security and privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA.

## **Implementation Notes**
- **Frontend**: Implement the skill search interface using React, providing components for multi-select skill filters and dropdowns for other criteria (e.g., location and availability). Use Redux for state management to maintain the search criteria across different components.
- **Backend**: Extend the existing Node.js/Express API to include a new endpoint for candidate search, implemented with appropriate query parameters to facilitate filtering.
- **Database**: Use PostgreSQL with appropriate indexing on skills and candidate profiles to facilitate quick lookups. Consider implementing an ElasticSearch instance for enhanced full-text search capabilities and to manage complex querying.
- **Semantic Search**: Investigate using a natural language processing library (e.g., spaCy or NLP.js) to map user skill queries to stored skill representations, enabling semantic search capabilities.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to remember frequently requested search results, potentially using Redis, to further improve performance.
- **Security Measures**: Ensure all data retrieved during the search maintains compliance with applicable privacy laws, including standardized measures for data handling and encryption.
- **Testing**: Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests using Jest and Supertest to validate the accuracy and performance of the search functionality, specifically focusing on edge cases and large datasets to ensure robustness.
- **Documentation**: Maintain documentation on how to utilize the search feature, outlining the various search parameters available and example use cases for recruiters.
